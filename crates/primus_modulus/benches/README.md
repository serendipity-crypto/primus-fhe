# Modulus benchmark coverage

- `scalar_moduli`: single-value arithmetic across modulus implementations.
- `barrett_scalar`: canonical/lazy Barrett multiplication and reduction.
- `slice_moduli`: existing Compact/Uint add/sub and Native/PowOf2 add,
  elementwise multiplication, and dot products.
- `barrett_slice`: canonical/lazy elementwise multiplication, dot products,
  and batch inversion.
- `signed_encoding`: bounded signed-to-residue conversion for Native/PowOf2/Barrett,
  u32/u64, at lengths 1024 and 16384. One iteration fills one slice of mixed
  signed coefficients in [-38, 38]; allocation and input generation are excluded.
- `slice_arithmetic`: Native/Barrett u32/u64 subtraction, negation, broadcast
  scalar multiplication, scalar multiply-add, and in-place add/sub. Barrett
  output-add is included; Native output-add remains in `slice_moduli`.

`slice_arithmetic` targets the kernels called by lattice ciphertext arithmetic.
Its explicit moduli match `primus_factor/benches/shoup_factor.rs`: 132120577 for
u32 and 1125899906826241 for u64, with multiplier 17 and matching deterministic
input data. Compare broadcast scalar multiplication against the corresponding
precomputed-factor operation, not against elementwise slice multiplication.
Lattice scalar multiply-subtract uses scalar negation followed by the same
multiply-add kernel, so it does not need a second identical kernel benchmark.

Lengths 1024 and 4096 cover polynomial-sized buffers; 1025 also exercises SIMD
tails and packed ciphertext lengths. Native u64 inputs cover the full word
range except u64::MAX. Repeated canonical in-place operations require no reset.
One iteration processes one slice; allocation, input generation and factor
precomputation are excluded. Throughput counts elements, not bytes. These are
warm repeated-buffer measurements, not full ciphertext/RNS traversal timings.

```sh
cargo bench -p primus_modulus --bench slice_arithmetic
cargo bench -p primus_modulus --bench slice_arithmetic -- --test
cargo +nightly bench -p primus_modulus --bench slice_arithmetic --features simd
```

Keep machine, features and toolchain fixed for comparisons. SIMD dispatch and
ordinary compiler vectorization are distinct; the default build is not a
promise of scalar-only machine code. No new PowOf2/Compact/Uint matrix or
single-value negation benchmark is added for the current Native/Barrett lattice
workloads; their existing comparisons remain available.
