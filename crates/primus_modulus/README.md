# primus_modulus

English | [简体中文](README.zh_CN.md)

`primus_modulus` provides the concrete modulus contexts and arithmetic kernels that implement the contracts defined by [`primus_reduce`](../primus_reduce/README.md).

> [!WARNING]
> This crate is part of the experimental [Primus FHE](../../README.md) workspace. Its API and numerical contracts are unstable and may change incompatibly at any time.

## Modulus types

| Type | Modulus | Intended use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NativeModulus<T>` | implicit `2^T::BITS` | wrapping arithmetic in the native word ring |
| `PowOf2Modulus<T>` | representable power of two greater than one | mask-based arithmetic for an explicit power-of-two modulus |
| `BarrettModulus<T>` | `1 < modulus < 2^(T::BITS - 2)` | repeated multiplication, wide reduction, fused slice operations, and dot products |
| `CompactModulus<T>` | `1 < modulus < 2^(T::BITS - 2)` | basic add, subtract, negate, and inverse operations without precomputed data |
| `UintModulus<T>` | any representable `modulus > 1` | basic arithmetic when the compact range restriction is unsuitable |

`BarrettModulus` stores the little-endian limbs `[low, high]` of `floor(B² / modulus)`, where `B = 2^T::BITS`. The two spare modulus bits permit its dot-product kernels to accumulate 16 products before reduction. `CompactModulus` and `UintModulus` store only the modulus.

## Example

```rust
use primus_modulus::{BarrettModulus, reduce::prelude::*};

let modulus = BarrettModulus::new(97u64);

assert_eq!(modulus.reduce_add(80, 30), 13);
assert_eq!(modulus.reduce_mul(12, 9), 11);

let lhs = [12, 20, 31];
let rhs = [9, 10, 11];
let mut output = [0; 3];
modulus.reduce_mul_slice_to(&lhs, &rhs, &mut output);
assert_eq!(output, [11, 6, 50]);
```

## Choosing and constructing a modulus

- Use `NativeModulus::new()` when overflow itself represents reduction modulo the full word range.
- Use `PowOf2Modulus::new(value)` for a representable power-of-two modulus.
- Use `BarrettModulus::new(value)` when multiplication and repeated reduction are required for a modulus in the supported Barrett range.
- Use `CompactModulus::new(value)` or `UintModulus::new(value)` for their smaller basic-operation sets.

Checked constructors validate their documented range. `CompactModulus(value)` and `UintModulus(value)` remain available when an already-validated caller intentionally avoids a repeated check. Likewise, `BarrettModulus::new_unchecked`, `BarrettModulus::from_parts`, and `SimdBarrettModulus::from_parts` require the caller to uphold their documented reciprocal and range invariants.

## Features

- `derive` re-exports the `Barrett` derive macro for compile-time constant moduli. See [`primus_barrett_derive`](../primus_barrett_derive/README.md).
- `simd` enables nightly portable-SIMD kernels and slice dispatch. When `derive` is also enabled, generated Barrett contexts use the corresponding SIMD paths.

Both features are disabled by default. The `simd` feature requires a nightly Rust toolchain.

## Arithmetic contracts

The operation traits, input ranges, output ranges, and slice-length requirements come from `primus_reduce`.

- Canonical operations generally require canonical residues unless their trait documents a wider input domain.
- Lazy operations return representatives in `[0, 2 * modulus)` and require a final once-reduction before canonical use.
- Low-level slice kernels may use `debug_assert*!` for shape diagnostics; release callers must uphold the documented length contracts.
- `FieldContext` is a capability marker. It does not prove primality or guarantee that every nonzero value is invertible.
- `EncodeSigned` converts coefficients with unsigned magnitude less than the explicit modulus; Native accepts every signed value. Native preserves the bit pattern, PowOf2 applies its mask, and Uint/Compact/Barrett share the explicit-modulus conversion. The default slice method checks equal lengths once and uses the concrete scalar implementation.
- `ReduceDotProductSigned` fuses bounded signed encoding with dot products for Native, PowOf2, Barrett and derived Barrett. It checks equal lengths once and returns zero for empty slices. Barrett encodes before wide accumulation, preserving the 16-product bound; SIMD handles full chunks and a scalar tail.
