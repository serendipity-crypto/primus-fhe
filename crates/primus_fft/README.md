# primus_fft

English | [简体中文](README.zh_CN.md)

`primus_fft` provides negacyclic Fourier transforms for polynomials in
`Z[X] / (X^N + 1)`. It exposes a common table-and-workspace API over RustFFT
and `tfhe-fft`, together with the torus conversions used by the Fourier FHE
paths in [Primus FHE](../../README.md).

> [!WARNING]
> This crate is part of the experimental Primus FHE workspace. Its API,
> Fourier representation, and numerical contracts are unstable and may change
> incompatibly at any time.

## Core types

| Type | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `FftTable` | Backend-independent negacyclic transform contract for one polynomial length |
| `RustFftTable` | `FftTable` implementation backed by RustFFT |
| `TfheFftTable` | `FftTable` implementation backed by the unordered `tfhe-fft` plan |
| `FftEngine<'a, Table>` | A reference to one immutable table plus one reusable mutable workspace |
| `TorusFftValue` | Conversion between unsigned `u16`, `u32`, or `u64` torus bit patterns and `f64` |

For `N = 2^log_n`, each table transforms `N` coefficients into `N / 2`
complex values. The table owns the backend plan and twist factors; the engine
owns the temporary memory used by each transform.

## Example

```rust
use primus_fft::{Complex64, FftEngine, FftTable, RustFftTable};

let table = RustFftTable::new(3).unwrap(); // N = 8
let mut fft = FftEngine::new(&table);
let input: Vec<u32> = (0..fft.poly_length()).map(|value| value as u32).collect();
let mut fourier = vec![Complex64::default(); fft.fourier_length()];
let mut output = vec![0u32; fft.poly_length()];

fft.forward_as_torus(&input, &mut fourier);
fft.backward_as_torus(&fourier, &mut output);

assert_eq!(output, input);
```

## Transform variants

- `forward_as_torus` reinterprets each unsigned word as its signed bit pattern,
  then scales it by `2^-BITS`. For example, `u32::MAX` represents `-1 / 2^32`.
- `forward_as_integer` performs the same signed-bit-pattern interpretation
  without torus scaling. It is intended for small integer polynomials such as
  secret keys and decomposition digits.
- `forward_integer_f64` accepts integer-valued `f64` coefficients without an
  additional representation conversion.
- `backward_as_torus` applies the inverse transform, torus scaling, rounding,
  and wrapping conversion back to the selected unsigned word type.

A negacyclic convolution uses `forward_as_torus` for a torus polynomial,
`forward_as_integer` for an integer polynomial, point-wise complex
multiplication, and then `backward_as_torus`.

## Table and workspace contract

Construct one table in the context that owns a Fourier representation and
reuse it. Fourier values and scratch memory are bound to that exact table
instance. Do not mix values or scratch from independently constructed tables,
even when the backend and polynomial length are the same: backend ordering,
planning, and workspace compatibility are private properties of the table and
are not part of a cross-table compatibility guarantee.

Tables are immutable and implement `Send + Sync`, so a table may be shared
across threads. Each concurrent worker must create its own `FftEngine` (or its
own scratch through `new_scratch`); mutable workspace is never shared between
transform calls.

Input and output lengths are exact:

- coefficient slices contain `poly_length()` values;
- Fourier slices contain `fourier_length() == poly_length() / 2` values;
- scratch passed directly to `FftTable` methods must have been allocated by
  that table instance.

Incorrect lengths or incompatible workspace cause a panic.

`FftTable::automorphism_map(degree)` allocates the Fourier map for `X -> X^degree`, where `degree` is odd and in `[1, 2N)`. Entry `j` gives `(source, conjugate)` for output `j`.

Build and cache the map during evaluation-key construction, and reuse the originating table instance. Custom `FftTable` implementations must provide the map for their own storage order. Applying the map alone does not perform cryptographic key switching.

## Length and precision

`FftTable::new(log_n)` accepts `2 <= log_n <= usize::BITS - 1`, so the minimum
supported polynomial length is four. Table construction performs backend
planning and allocation; it should stay outside repeated transform paths.

The transform uses `f64` and is approximate. Whether a Fourier computation can
be rounded back to the intended torus value depends on the accumulated
floating-point error and the magnitude of the integer operands; higher-level
algorithms are responsible for maintaining a suitable precision budget.
