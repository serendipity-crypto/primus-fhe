# primus_glwe

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh_CN.md)

Single-modulus GLWE keys and operations, with separate NTT and native-torus Fourier representations. Here `k` is the GLWE dimension and `N` the polynomial length.

## Keys and representation

| Type | Storage and role |
| --- | --- |
| `GlweSecretKey<T>` | Signed coefficient polynomials; sampling and input to key conversion/generation |
| `NttGlweSecretKey<T>` | Canonical NTT residues modulo `q`; NTT encryption and decryption |
| `FourierGlweSecretKey` | Integer-scaled Fourier secret polynomials; native-torus Fourier encryption and decryption |
| `NttGlwePublicKey<S>` | One NTT encryption of zero; public-key encryption |

Use `generate` for randomized generation. Keys do not store transform tables: preserve the modulus and transform representation used at generation. Raw public-key bytes use native endianness and contain no parameter metadata.

## Encryption and decryption

NTT secret, Fourier secret and NTT public keys share these ordinary encryption methods:

| Method | Input | Output storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `encrypt` / `encrypt_to` | Plaintext in `[0, t)`, unsigned embedding | Allocate / overwrite |
| `encrypt_centered_to` | Plaintext in `[0, t)`, centered embedding | Overwrite |
| `encrypt_encoded_to` | Already encoded ciphertext-ring coefficients | Overwrite; no plaintext scaling |
| `encrypt_zeros` / `encrypt_zeros_to` | Zero polynomial | Allocate / overwrite |

Secret keys provide `decrypt`, `decrypt_to` and `phase_to`. Phase extraction returns noisy coefficient-domain values without decoding; both plaintext embeddings use the same decoder. Decryption returns the message's unsigned integer type.

```text
ntt_sk.encrypt_to(input, output, params, ntt_table, rng)
ntt_pk.encrypt_to(input, output, params, ntt_table, rng, context)
fourier_sk.encrypt_to(input, output, params, fft, rng, context)
ntt_sk.phase_to(input, output, modulus, ntt_table)
fourier_sk.phase_to(input, output, fft, context)
```

NTT secret-key ordinary operations need no context. Fourier operations use `FourierGlweEncryptContext<T>` / `FourierGlweDecryptContext`; NTT public encryption uses `NttGlwePublicEncryptContext<T>`. Construct these with `N` and reuse them at that length. Contexts hold scratch, not parameters, and erase secret intermediates on drop.

`_to` paths reuse output and scratch. Layout/transform mismatches fail before output writes. Invalid plaintext values may panic after partial writes or randomness consumption. Encoded NTT inputs must be canonical residues in `[0, q)`; callers guarantee this range.

## Gadget and truncated ciphertexts

`encrypt_glev_to` and `encrypt_ggsw_to` apply the gadget basis to a coefficient-domain ring polynomial without plaintext scaling. A GGSW control bit is therefore the constant polynomial `0` or `1`. Both use a gadget context constructed from `GadgetSize`: GLev requires a matching polynomial length; GGSW also requires a matching level count.

`encrypt_ggsw_constant_batch_to` encrypts canonical constants into consecutive NTT GGSWs, with one batch validation and no temporary allocation. Output length is `input.len() * params.ggsw_len()`.

NTT `encrypt_truncated_zeros`, `phase_truncated` and `decrypt_truncated` operate on coefficient ciphertexts with a full mask and at most `N` body coefficients. Phase extraction and decryption return only the retained coefficients, while their internal scratch still holds full polynomials.

## Evaluation primitives

Evaluation keys own their layouts and decomposition bases. NTT evaluation takes `input, output, modulus, ntt, context`; Fourier evaluation omits `modulus`. Contexts are reusable workspaces. Preserve the key's transform representation: matching lengths and moduli alone do not prove compatibility.

Both automorphism keys provide coefficient-domain `apply_to`. `NttGlweAutomorphismKey::apply_ntt_to` and `FourierGlweAutomorphismKey::apply_fourier_to` reuse the same key for transform-domain input/output. Fourier evaluation requires the exact FFT table instance used at key generation; direct Fourier input/output can round differently from a coefficient roundtrip.

`NttGlweTraceKey<T>` and `FourierGlweTraceKey<T>` share their automorphism material across the following coefficient-domain operations. `M` denotes the input message; every output phase coefficient may contain evaluation error.

| Trace-key method | Target message |
| --- | --- |
| `apply_to` / `apply_reverse_to` | Constant `N*M[0]` / `M[0]` |
| `apply_partial_to(input, r, ...)` | `d * sum_j M[j*d] X^(j*d)`, where `d=N/r` |
| `apply_reverse_partial_to(input, r, ...)` | `sum_j M[j*d] X^(j*d)` |
| `project_coefficient_to` / `project_coefficients_to` | Constant `M[index]` / constants in selection order |
| `expand_coefficients_to` | `N` constant GLWEs in coefficient order |
| `expand_partial_coefficients_to(input, count, ...)` | First `count` constants, assuming a zero message tail |
| `pack_lwe_to` / `pack_lwes_to` | Constant LWE message / `sum_i m[i] X^(i*N/p)` for `p` LWEs |

Partial trace's `retained_coefficient_count` (`r`) is a power of two in `1..=N`. It retains equally spaced positions in one GLWE: `N=8, r=2` retains indices 0 and 4. `r=N` copies the input; `r=1` is full trace. Reverse trace scales before each automorphism/addition: NTT multiplies by `2^-1 mod q`; Fourier uses unsigned coefficient `floor(x/2)`. The NTT field operation does not inherit the torus RevHomTrace noise bound.

Projection accepts arbitrary indices, including duplicates and an empty selection. It uses one reverse trace per index and writes `indices.len() * size.glwe_len()` values. Partial expansion instead builds a shared tree in `count` output GLWE blocks, using `count-1` automorphisms after normalizing once by `count`. `count` must be a power of two in `1..=N`; `count=1` copies the input and `count=N` is full expansion. NTT normalization uses the field inverse; Fourier uses unsigned floor division. These paths have different error behavior.

For partial expansion to produce constants, message coefficients `count..N` must be zero. This unchecked premise concerns the message, not ciphertext masks or bodies. Otherwise output `i` targets `sum_j M[i+j*count] X^(j*count)`. All outputs retain ring degree `N` and use the ordinary trace context.

Packing uses the [RevHomTrace algorithm](https://github.com/Stirling75/RevHomTrace/blob/main/src/glwe_conv_rev.rs). Each LWE must have dimension `k*N`, the flattened GLWE secret, and the same modulus and encoding. A batch is a flat slice of `p` complete LWEs, where `p` is a power of two in `1..=N`; slots are adjacent only at `p=N`. Construct `NttGlwePackingContext::new(size, p)` or `FourierGlwePackingContext::new(size, p)` for that fixed count. Single-LWE packing uses a trace context. Evaluation reuses output and scratch, checking shapes, indices and backend compatibility before writes.

## Source and tests

[Secret keys](src/secret_key), [public keys](src/public_key), [key switching](src/key_switch), [automorphism](src/automorphism), [trace/packing](src/trace) and [scheme switching](src/scheme_switch.rs) contain the public contracts and implementation details.

Tests are grouped by operation: ordinary key workflows, gadget phases and external products, CMUX, key switching, automorphism, scheme switching, and trace/expansion/packing. `tests/common` holds the small schoolbook phase oracle shared by automorphism and trace tests. Boundary rejection and capacity zeroization have dedicated test binaries. Fourier automorphism and trace/packing tests exercise both RustFFT and tfhe-fft.

```sh
cargo test -p primus_glwe
cargo clippy -p primus_glwe --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo +nightly test -p primus_glwe --features simd
```

## Benchmarks

```sh
cargo bench -p primus_glwe --bench encryption
cargo bench -p primus_glwe --bench primitives
# Check every case without collecting timing samples:
cargo bench -p primus_glwe -- --test
```

Both benches use `(k, N) = (1, 1024)` and `(2, 4096)`. Each iteration performs one operation with reusable output/scratch; key/table construction and allocation remain outside timing. Parameters and fixed seeds are recorded in the bench sources. These workloads track regressions rather than compare matched security; they are not security parameter recommendations.

| Bench | Work measured |
| --- | --- |
| [encryption](benches/encryption.rs) | Secret/public encryption, secret decryption, GLev/GGSW generation; includes sampling, coding and required transforms |
| [primitives](benches/primitives.rs) | Ordinary/reverse trace; projection and partial expansion for 8 and `N/8` coefficients; full expansion; packing 1, 8 and `N` LWEs; direct Fourier automorphism on both FFT backends |

Ordinary and reverse trace measure their respective API scales. Projection/partial expansion use the same encrypted zero-tail message and report output-message throughput. Codec variants are benchmarked in `primus_encoding`.
